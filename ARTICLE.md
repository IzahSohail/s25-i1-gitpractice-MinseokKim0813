## How Chinese AI Startup DeepSeek Made a Model that Rivals OpenAI

### https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-china-model-ai/

This article talks about Deepseek, an open-source AI LLM developed by China. I think it is very interesting as it is open-source and requires much less budget compared to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Consequently, the need for GPU for the LLM has dropped; and the stock price for NVIDIA significantly also dropped. It is going to be interesting watching the competition in AI models between China and the US.

Interesting choice. Yes, Deepseek is the new hot topic now; planning to look into it soon to see if we can save some research money by relying on it instead of OpenAI's models :)
